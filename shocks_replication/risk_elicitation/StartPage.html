  <p>
    Thank you for your participation in the first part of this experiment. We move on to an individual component that is
    described to you below.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the questions that follow, you are going to be asked to make ten decisions. Each decision will be between Option A
    and Option B. One of the ten choices you make will be randomly selected to determine your earnings for this part of
    the experiment.
  </p>

  <p>
    After making all ten choices, the computer will randomly select one of the and display which decision you chose. The
    computer will "roll" a 10-sided die to produce a number between one and ten. The die-roll will determine the outcome of the
    selected lottery.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following are examples of how your earnings are determined.
  </p>

  <p>
    Example 1: Suppose the computer randomly selected the following decision.
  </p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Options</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>Your Choice</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$1 or $3 each with probability 1/2</td>
        <td>$0.1 with probability 9/10 or $5 with probability 1/10</td>
        <td>A or B</td>
    </tr>
</table>

  <p>
    Suppose that for this decision you selected Option A. If the computer "rolls" any number 1 through 5, you will receive $3.
    If the computer "rolls" any number 6 through 10, you will receive $1.
  </p>

<p>
  Example 2: Suppose the computer randomly selected the following decision.
</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Options</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>Your Choice</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$1 or $3 each with probability 1/2</td>
        <td>$0.1 with probability 3/10 or $5 with probability 7/10</td>
        <td>A or B</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Suppose that for this decision you selected B. If the computer "rolls" any number 1 through 7, you will receive $5.
  If the computer rolls 8 through 10, you will receive $0.1.
</p>

  <p>
    You may choose Option A for some decisions and Option B for others. Your earnings for this part of the experiment will
    be added to your earnings from the other part of the experiment and included in your cash payment.
