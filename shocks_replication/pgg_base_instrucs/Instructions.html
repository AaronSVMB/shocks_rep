<p>
    This experiment is a study of group and individual behavior.
    Everyone in this experiment is receiving exactly the same instructions.
    You will earn {{participant.payoff_plus_participation_fee()}} simply for participating in this experiment.
    But if you follow the instructions and make careful decisions, you can earn a significant amount of additional money.
    You will be paid, privately, at the end of the experiment in cash.
</p>

<p>
    During the experiment your earnings will be measured in tokens.
    Each token is worth <u>4</u> cents, so
    at the end of the experiment your tokens will be converted to dollars at the rate of <u>25</u> tokens per dollar.
</p>

<p>
    It is important that you remain silent and not look at other people's work during the experiment.
    If you talk, laugh, or exclaim out loud you will be asked to leave and will not be paid.
    If you have questions or need assistance, raise your hand and an experimenter will come to you.
</p>

<h2>A. Your Group:</h2>

<p>
    Each participant will be <strong>randomly</strong> assigned an ID number and randomly assigned to a four-person group.
    The groups will remain the same throughout the entire experiment.
    There are <strong>16</strong> participants in today's experiment,
    so there will be <strong>4</strong> groups in all with <strong>4</strong> members in each group.
    Because you will be known only by your random ID number,
    there will be no way for anyone (including experimenters) to know which group you are in or what decisions you make.
</p>

<h2>B. Your Investment Decisions:</h2>

<p>
    The experiment includes <u>20</u> decision-making periods.
    At the start of each period you will receive 10 new tokens.
    You must decide how many of these 10 tokens you want to invest in your group’s joint account
    versus how many you want to invest in your own personal account.
</p>
<p>
    The tokens you invest in your personal account will be directly added to your earnings.
    (For example, if you invest 4 tokens in your personal account then you will earn 4 tokens from your personal account.)
</p>

<p>
    Earnings from your group’s joint account will depend on the total number of tokens that you and the other members
    of your group invest in the joint account.  Each member will earn 0.5 times the total number of tokens invested in
    the joint account.  (For example, if each member of your group invested 6 tokens in the joint account,
    then the total group investment would be 24 tokens, and each member would earn 0.5 x 24 tokens, which equals 12 tokens.)
</p>

<p>
    To make your investment decisions, simply enter a number between 0.00 and 10.00 indicating the amount you want to
    invest in your group’s joint account.  The computer will automatically invest the rest of your 10 tokens in your
    personal account.  (For example, if you enter the number 6.0, then 6 of your tokens will go into your group’s joint
    account and the computer will put your remaining 4 tokens into your own personal account.)
</p>

<h2>C. Your Earnings:</h2>

<p>
    At the end of each period the computer will show you how much you invested in each account,
    the total amount that was invested in your group’s joint account, and how much you earned from each account.
    You will not see how each of the other members in your group divided their tokens between their own personal
    accounts and the group’s joint account.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Your overall earnings in each period will be your earnings from the joint account
        plus your earnings from your personal account.</strong>
</p>

<h3>D. Examples:</h3>

<p>
    Table 1 shows what happens if you invest 6 tokens in your group’s joint account,
    while the second member of your group invests 3 tokens, the third member invests 1, and the fourth invests 10.
    The <i>total</i> number of tokens invested in the joint account is 6+3+1+10 = 20, and 0.5*20 = 10.
    So each member earns 10 tokens from the joint account.
    You yourself earn an additional (10-6) = 4 tokens from your personal account,
    the second member earns an additional 7 tokens, the third member earns an additional 9 tokens,
    and the fourth member earns an additional 0 tokens.
    You earn 14 tokens in all, 10 from the joint account and 4 from your personal account.
    As you can see in the bottom row of the table, the other members earn 17, 19, and 10.

<p>
    Table 2 shows what happens if you invest 3.5 tokens in the joint account,
    while the second member of invests 6.5 tokens in the joint account, the third invests 0, and the fourth invests 9.
    The total amount invested in the joint account is 3.5+6.5+0+9 = 19, and 0.5*19 = 9.5.
    So each member earns 9.5 tokens from the joint account.
    You yourself earn an additional 6.5 tokens from your personal account, so you earn 16 token in all.
    The other members earn 13, 19.5, and 10.5.

    Table 3 shows what happens if you invest all 10 of your tokens in the joint account,
    while the other three members do the same.
    Because the total joint investment is 40 and 0.5*40 20, you earn 20 overall and the other members earn the same.
