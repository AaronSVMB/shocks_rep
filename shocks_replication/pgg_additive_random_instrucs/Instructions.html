<p>
    This experiment is a study of group and individual behavior.
    Everyone in this experiment is receiving exactly the same instructions.
    You will earn {{participant.payoff_plus_participation_fee()}} simply for participating in this experiment.
    But if you follow the instructions and make careful decisions, you can earn a significant amount of additional money.
    You will be paid at the end of the experiment in cash.
</p>

<p>
    During the experiment your earnings will be measured in tokens.
    Each token is worth <u>4</u> cents, so
    at the end of the experiment your tokens will be converted to dollars at the rate of <u>25</u> tokens per dollar.
</p>

<p>
    It is important that you remain silent and not look at other people's work during the experiment.
    If you talk, laugh, or exclaim out loud you will be asked to leave and will not be paid.
    If you have questions or need assistance, raise your hand and an experimenter will come to you.
</p>

<h2>A. Your Group:</h2>


<p>
    Each participant will be <strong>randomly</strong> assigned an ID number and randomly assigned to a four-person group.
    The groups will remain the same throughout the entire experiment.
    There are <strong>16</strong> participants in today's experiment,
    so there will be <strong>4</strong> groups in all with <strong>4</strong> members in each group.
    Because you will be known only by your random ID number,
    there will be no way for anyone (including experimenters) to know which group you are in or what decisions you make.
</p>

<h2>B. Your Decisions:</h2>

<p>
    The experiment includes <strong>20</strong> decision-making periods, and each period consists of <strong>2</strong> stages.
    At the start of each period you will receive <strong>10</strong> new tokens.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Stage 1:</strong> In the first stage of each period,
    you must decide how many of your 10 new tokens you want to invest in your group’s <i>joint</i> account versus
    how many you want to invest in your own <i>personal</i> account.
</p>

<p>
    The tokens you invest in your <i>personal</i> account will be directly added to your earnings.
    (For example, if you invest 4 tokens in your personal account then you will <i>earn</i> 4 tokens from your personal account.)
</p>

<p>
    Earnings from your group’s <i>joint</i> account will depend on the <i>total</i> number of tokens that you
    <i>and</i> the other members of your group invest in the joint account.
    Each member will earn 0.5 times the <i>total</i> number of tokens invested in the joint account.
    (For example, if each member of your group invested 6 tokens in the joint account,
    then the <u>total</u> joint investment would be 24 tokens,
    and <u>each</u> member would earn 0.5 x 24 tokens, which equals 12 tokens.)
</p>

<p>
    To make your investment decisions,
    simply enter a number between 0.00 and 10.00 indicating the amount you want to invest in your group’s <i>joint</i> account.
    The computer will automatically invest the rest of your 10 tokens in your personal account.
    (For example, if you enter the number 6.0,
    then 6 of your tokens will go into your joint account
    and the computer will put your remaining 4 tokens into your <i>personal</i> account.)
</p>

<br>
<p>
    <strong>Stage 2:</strong> In the second stage of each period,
    the computer will make <i>adjustments</i> to the earnings of all the participants in the experiment.
    The adjustments will be either +5 or -5 tokens.
    The <u><i>same</i></u> adjustment will be made to the earnings of every member in your group,
    but the members of other groups may receive different adjustments.
    The computer will choose the adjustment for your group based on a <i>random</i> number calculation,
    so that there will be a 50% chance that 5 tokens are added to the earnings of
    everyone in your group and a 50% chance that 5 tokens are subtracted from every member’s earnings.
    The computer will calculate a <i>different</i> random number for each of the other three groups in the experiment.
</p>

<h2>C. Your Earnings:</h2>

<p>
    At the end of each period the computer will show you how much you <i>invested</i> in each account,
    the <i>total</i> amount that was invested in your group’s joint account,
    and how much you <i>earned</i> from each account.
    You will <i>not</i> see how each of the other members in your group divided their tokens
    between their own personal accounts and the group’s joint account.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        Your overall earnings in each period will be your earnings from the joint account,
        <i>plus</i> your earnings from your personal account, <i>plus</i> the computer’s adjustment.
    </strong>
</p>

<h2>D. Examples:</h2>

<p>
    Table 1 shows what happens if you invest 6 tokens in your group’s joint account,
    while the second member of your group invests 3 tokens, the third member invests 1, and the fourth invests 10,
    <i>and</i> the computer randomly chooses a +5 adjustment for your entire group.
    The <i>total</i> number of tokens invested in the joint account is 6+3+1+10 = 20, and 0.5*20 = 10.
    So each member earns 10 tokens from the joint account.
    You yourself earn an additional (10-6) = 4 tokens from your personal account,
    the second member earns an additional 7 tokens, the third member earns an additional 9 tokens,
    and the fourth member earns an additional 0 tokens.
    The computer’s randomly-chosen adjustment adds another 5 token to each member’s earnings.
    So you earn 19 tokens overall, 10 from the group’s account, 4 from your personal account,
    and 5 from the adjustment.
    As you can see in the bottom row of the table, the other members earn 22, 24, and 15.

    Table 2 shows what happens if you invest 3.50 tokens in your group’s account,
    while the second member of invests 6.50 tokens in the group account,
    the third invests 0, and the fourth invests 9,
    and the computer makes a -5 adjustment for your entire group.
    The total amount invested in the group’s account is 3.5+6.5+0+9 = 19,
    and 0.5*19 = 9.5.  So each member earns 9.5 tokens from the group account.
    You yourself earn an additional 6.5 tokens from your personal account.
    So you earn 11 tokens in all, 9.5 from the group’s account, 6.5 from your personal account,
    and -5 from the adjustment.
    The other members earn 8, 14.5, and 5.5.

    Table 3 shows what happens if you invest all 10 of your tokens in your group’s account,
    while the other three members do the same, and the computer’s randomly-chosen adjustment is +5.
    Because the total group investment is 40 and 0.5*40 = 20, you earn 25 overall, and the other members earn the same.
