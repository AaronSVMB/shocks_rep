  <strong>Question Four</strong>

<p>
    Below are a series of questions regarding your total earnings. They will help you gain an understanding
    of the calculation of your earnings, which varies with your decision on how to invest your {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} tokens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each group member, including you, receives {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} tokens. Suppose you invest <strong>5.5 tokens</strong> to
    your Group's Joint Account. Let's further suppose that the other members of your Group invest a combined
    <strong>16.5 tokens</strong> to the Group's Joint Account.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>Part A</i>
    <br> Recall: Joint Account Earnings = (Total Investment to the Group's Join Account) x ( 0.5 )
    <br>
  </p>

  {{ formfield 'comprehension_question_four_a' }}

  <p>
    <i>Part B</i>
    <br> Recall: Personal Account = 10 - ( Your Investment to the Group's Joint Account )
  </p>

  {{ formfield 'comprehension_question_four_b' }}

  <p>
    <i>Part C</i>
    <br> Recall: Period Earnings = ( Joint Account Earnings ) + ( Personal Account )
  </p>
